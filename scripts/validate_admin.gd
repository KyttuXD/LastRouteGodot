## Headless check on the admin overlay.
##
## Its whole reason to exist is that it must NOT exist in a normal build: every
## row either states what the game is thinking or reaches in and changes it.
## So what is worth testing is the gate, that both modes actually attach one,
## that its readouts do not throw, and that its actions do what they say.
##
## Run with:
##   godot4 --headless res://scenes/validate.tscn -- admin
